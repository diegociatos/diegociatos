<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed the Ciatos Recrutamento ATS from initial setup through several functional enhancements, following a phased approach for complex features. Key accomplishments include implementing multi-tenant architecture, refining role-based access control, and improving user management. Initially, the engineer addressed authentication and UI issues, such as  errors and frontend display problems. User feedback led to features like admin-defined initial user passwords and an improved user table with role display and enhanced action buttons.

Subsequently, the project adopted a four-phase development strategy. Phase 1 focused on core data models, basic recruiter dashboard KPIs, and job listings. Phase 2 introduced a Kanban board for job pipelines with drag-and-drop functionality and stage history. Phase 3 developed a comprehensive notification system, including in-app alerts, email, and user preferences. Phase 4 implemented interview scheduling with a modal, calendar view, and automated reminders. Recurring challenges revolved around persistent  errors during authentication and session handling, which frequently blocked progress and required investigation. The engineer iteratively refined both backend APIs and React frontend components based on detailed user requirements and visual feedback.

The Ciatos Recrutamento ATS is a multi-tenant application supporting Administrators, Recruitment Analysts, Clients, and Candidates. It features a multi-stage job workflow, custom questionnaires, a 0-100 candidate scoring algorithm, role-specific dashboards, LGPD compliance, email notifications, and an SEO-friendly career site. Authentication uses JWT with RBAC, comprehensive CRUD APIs, and React-based Admin/Analyst/Client panels. Each user type is redirected to a custom dashboard upon login, with robust logout and unauthenticated access handling. Recent and ongoing work includes:

1.  **Admin User Management**: Admin can create users, define initial passwords (with optional ), reset/alter existing passwords manually, and deactivate users. The user table displays user roles, and action buttons for editing, changing password, and deactivating are visually improved.
2.  **Recruiter Dashboard (Phase 1 Implemented)**: Operational view with KPIs (active jobs, active candidates), a table of managed jobs (title, client, status, candidate counts by stage, last update), and global search/filters.
3.  **Kanban Process Board (Phase 2 Implemented)**: Per-job Kanban board where cards represent candidates (applications). Stages include 'submitted', 'screening', 'recruiter_interview', 'shortlisted', 'client_interview', 'offer', 'hired', 'rejected', 'withdrawn'. Supports drag & drop to move candidates between stages, updates  and , and triggers basic notifications.
4.  **Notification System (Phase 3 Implemented)**: In-app notifications (bell icon with badge), email notifications via SMTP, user preferences for event types and channels, APIs for listing/marking notifications, and a worker for asynchronous email sending.
5.  **Interview Scheduling (Phase 4 Implemented)**: CRUD operations for interviews, a scheduling modal (date/time, type, location, interviewer, notes), calendar views for recruiters, automated T-24h/T-2h reminders, and interview status tracking.
6.  **Job Edit Page for Analyst**: An analyst needs to be able to view and edit job details, including status and candidates, from a dedicated job editing page.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure in , with distinct  (FastAPI) and  (React) directories.



-   : Defines Pydantic models. Modified extensively to include  in , and new , , , , ,  models. It also includes  and  models for backend API updates. Duplicates for  and  were resolved. The  model was updated to include .
-   : Main FastAPI application. Modified to register new routers (, , , ) and to initialize the .
-   : Original database seeding script.
-   : New seeding script created specifically for Phase 1 data, later updated to include  for Phase 2, and additional entities for Phases 3 and 4. It handles existing users/applications to avoid duplicates.
-   : Handles authentication logic. Currently being investigated and fixed for  related to session handling.
-   : Handles authentication. Modified login to return  and the  endpoint to accept an optional  field for admin-defined initial passwords.
-   : User-related API endpoints. Expanded to include routes for Admin to create, edit, deactivate users, reset passwords, and now alterar (change) passwords manually, with . The GET  endpoint was updated to return user roles.
-   : Job-related API endpoints. The PATCH  endpoint was enhanced to update more job fields based on  model changes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user's report that the Job Edit Page for the analyst profile was not working; specifically, the user Continuo n√£o conseguindo editar vaga (Still can't edit job).

Upon investigation, the AI engineer identified a recurring backend error:  originating from the  function within . This error indicates that the application's authentication middleware or session handling logic is attempting to access an  field from a user session that either does not exist or is malformed. This issue has intermittently surfaced throughout the development trajectory, impacting various API calls despite successful login attempts. The engineer confirmed the API for fetching a specific job works, but the API for *editing* the job returns a 500 error due to this underlying session key error.

The engineer's last action was to confirm the problem is located in  and specifically in how  is being accessed.

**File being analyzed/modified:** 
**Problem:**  during API calls, specifically observed during job editing.
