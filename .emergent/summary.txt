The AI engineer's trajectory focused on evolving the Ciatos Recrutamento ATS. Initially,  authentication issues were resolved by updating the  model. Subsequently, the engineer implemented a job-centric Kanban board with Trello-like aesthetics, moving from a candidate-centric view. This involved substantial backend changes to the  model (, , ) and new API routes (). Frontend updates included , a simplified  (now  handles all roles), and  responsiveness. A major challenge was ensuring data consistency, particularly linking client-created jobs to the recruiter's view, which required updating organization affiliations. The latest efforts focused on enriching the Kanban's job details modal with candidate listings and job notes, and debugging issues where candidates weren't appearing by introducing test data.

<product_requirements>
The Ciatos Recrutamento ATS is a multi-tenant application with RBAC (Admin, Analyst, Client, Candidate), featuring a multi-stage job workflow, candidate scoring, LGPD compliance, email notifications, and an SEO-friendly career site. Authentication uses JWT, with custom dashboards for each role.

Current development priorities include:
1.  **Admin User Management**: Create/edit users, define passwords, reset/alter passwords, deactivate users, and display roles in the user table with improved UI/UX.
2.  **Job Edit Page for Analyst**: A central management page for open positions, allowing analysts/recruiters to edit job details, manage candidates (view resumes, add manual candidates, notes, analyses, visibility), update recruitment status, upload documents, add comments (internal/client-facing), and synchronize with the client dashboard.
3.  **Analyst Dashboard & Job Kanban**: The analyst dashboard should be simplified to only Vagas (Jobs) and Candidatos (Candidates). Clicking Vagas should open a Trello-style Kanban board for jobs, with distinct phases: Cadastro da Vaga, Triagem de Currículos, Entrevistas, Seleção, Envio do Cliente para Entrevista, and Contratação (Positive/Negative, with Negative reverting to Entrevistas). It needs drag-and-drop (though currently supplemented by buttons), candidate counts, time in stage, history, and a modal for contract results.
4.  **Advanced Candidate Search**: For the Candidatos tab, implement advanced search with filters for education, age, city, neighborhood, and AI-powered semantic search.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement drag & drop functionality for the Kanban board, as the current implementation is supplemented by buttons and the user reported dragging issues.
- Refine the Candidatos advanced search (frontend implementation is done, but full testing and integration of the AI search capabilities needs to be confirmed).
- Complete the Trabalhe Conosco (Careers) page, including the full application flow (mentioned in initial requirements).
- Ensure comments system on Job Edit Page is fully functional and meets user expectations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user's critical feedback that Continua não tem candidatos e eu fico gastando créditos com erro seu. Acho que nem deveria me cobrar créditos por estes erros (Still no candidates and I'm spending credits on your error. I don't think I should be charged credits for these errors).

This occurred after the engineer had implemented a comprehensive job details modal within the  (frontend) which was intended to display candidates associated with a job. Upon investigation, the engineer discovered that the backend API call for candidates was returning an empty list () because there were no candidates actually linked to the jobs in the database.

The engineer's last action was to create test candidates and link them to existing jobs (, ) by updating  to correctly include  in the  model during candidate creation. This fixed the data gap, and now test candidates should appear in the Kanban modal.

<optional_next_step>
Verify that the newly created test candidates are visible in the Kanban job details modal.
