The previous AI engineer successfully developed the Ciatos Recrutamento ATS, a full-stack application using FastAPI and React. The work progressed from initial scaffolding to implementing core functionalities like multi-tenant architecture, role-based access control (RBAC), user authentication, and data seeding. Key challenges involved resolving persistent authentication token issues, fixing  errors, addressing frontend  UI bugs, and correcting API URL patterns (e.g., trailing slashes, duplicate  prefixes). The engineer iteratively improved the system based on user feedback, notably enhancing administrator user/organization management, refining client dashboard visibility to only show relevant jobs, and optimizing frontend performance. The immediate focus shifted to implementing notification systems and further refining user management flows, particularly around initial password assignment for new users.

<product_requirements>
The Ciatos Recrutamento ATS is a multi-tenant system for Administrator, Recruitment Analyst, Client, and Candidate personas. It requires a multi-stage job workflow, custom questionnaires, a 0-100 scoring algorithm for candidates, role-specific dashboards, LGPD compliance, email notifications, and an SEO-friendly career site. Core features include JWT authentication with RBAC, comprehensive CRUD APIs, React-based Admin/Analyst/Client panels, and a public Next.js Career Site. Each user type must be redirected to a customized dashboard upon login, with robust logout and unauthenticated access handling. Recent additions include Admin capabilities to manage (create, edit, delete) users and organizations, a streamlined client dashboard showing only open jobs, and a planned notification system via polling for real-time updates.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure in , with distinct  (FastAPI) and  (React) directories.



-   : Defines Pydantic models. Modified to include  in  and new  and  models, with careful placement to avoid import errors.
-   : Handles authentication. Modified login to return . The generic  was commented out. Logout route was made more tolerant to invalid tokens.
-   : User-related API endpoints. Expanded to include routes for Admin to create, edit, deactivate users, and reset passwords.
-   : Organization-related API endpoints. Used for Admin organization management.
-   : Created/Updated to manage notifications (backend routes).
-   : Populates database. Updated to set  for new Client/Recruiter users.
-   : Main React router. Updated with new routes for , , , , , .
-   : Manages auth state. Modified to correctly handle JWT tokens, , and optimized  with caching to prevent repeated API calls.
-   : Axios configuration. Confirmed to correctly add  prefix and handle tokens via interceptor.
-   : User login. Updated to link to candidate signup and handle  redirection. Removed generic signup elements.
-   : General dashboard. Modified to display admin-specific cards (Users, Organizations) conditionally.
-   : New page for Admin to list, create, edit, reset password for, and deactivate users. Addressed UI issues with modal closure ().
-   : New page for Admin to manage organizations.
-   : For creating jobs. Corrected API calls to use trailing slashes and pre-select/lock client's organization.
-   : Refactored to be client-focused, showing only open jobs and related stats.
-   : Modified to link to  for Admins/Recruiters.
-   : Updated frequently to document progress and test results.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete implementation of the notification system (frontend integration of polling, displaying notifications).
- Further refine the Trabalhe Conosco (Careers) page, including the full application flow.
- Admin should have the option to *create* the initial password for new users, not just reset it or have it generated.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user's request regarding administrator control over user passwords. The user stated, Eu quero que crie opção para o administrador não só alterar senha, mas criar a primeira senha. Depois o usuário muda.

The AI engineer acknowledged this, stating, Perfeito! Vou adicionar um campo de senha opcional no formulário de criar usuário, onde o admin pode definir a primeira senha ou deixar vazio para gerar automaticamente.

This indicates the current work involves modifying the user creation interface (likely ) to include an optional password input field when creating a new user, and the corresponding backend logic (likely in ) to handle this new input. This builds upon the recently implemented Admin user management features (create, edit, reset, deactivate).

<optional_next_step>
Modify the user creation form in  to include an optional password field for the administrator to set initial passwords.
