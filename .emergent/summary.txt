The AI engineer successfully initiated the Ciatos Recrutamento ATS, building a full-stack application with FastAPI backend and React frontend. Initial work focused on scaffolding the monorepo, installing dependencies, creating core API routes, database models, and basic frontend pages (login, dashboard, jobs, careers). Key achievements include successful database seeding, basic UI rendering, and API functionality. Throughout the process, the AI iteratively addressed user feedback, notably fixing date/time comparison errors in the backend, resolving  related authentication issues, and correcting URL construction for API calls. A significant portion of the work involved implementing a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system for Admin, Recruiter, Client, and Candidate, ensuring each user type is redirected to a specific, customized dashboard upon login. Documentation for these flows was also generated. The current state involves debugging issues related to page redirection for unauthenticated users and ensuring the logout functionality is fully operational across all dashboards.

The user requested a comprehensive Applicant Tracking System (ATS) named Ciatos Recrutamento, featuring a multi-tenant architecture to manage agencies and client organizations. It targets four distinct personas: Administrator (general tenant/user management), Recruitment Analyst (job creation, screening, interviews), Client (drafting jobs, pipeline tracking, final feedback), and Candidate (profile creation, job application, questionnaires, status tracking).

Key features to implement include:
- A multi-stage job workflow (draft to hire).
- Autoral questionnaires (DISC, Behavioral Profile, Recognition Languages) and custom job-specific questionnaires.
- A scoring algorithm (0-100) based on skills (40%), experience (20%), location (10%), behavioral profile (20%), and salary/availability (10%), with penalties for unmet 'must-have' skills.
- Role-specific dashboards for Client (pipeline, candidates), Analyst (funnel, qualification rate), and Agency (TTF/Hire, NPS).
- LGPD compliance (consent, export/erase, retention, anonymization).
- Email notifications (with hooks for WhatsApp/SMS).
- SEO-friendly career site with schema.org JobPosting and reCAPTCHA.
- Blind Review mode option.
- Authentication via JWT with refresh tokens and RBAC.
- APIs for CRUD operations on organizations, users, jobs, applications, candidates, etc.
- Frontend panels for Admin/Analyst (React) and Client (React), plus a public Career Site (Next.js).
- Specific UI flows: Client creates draft jobs, Analyst reviews/publishes, Candidates apply with CV/questionnaires, Analyst screens, Client interviews, etc. Each user must have access to specific pages/dashboards, and the system should identify the user role upon login and redirect them to their respective interface. Logout functionality and proper redirection for unauthenticated access are critical.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo structure within the  directory, containing distinct  (FastAPI) and  (React) applications.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : The main FastAPI application entry point. It sets up routes, database connections, and middleware. Modified during initial setup and bug fixes.
-   : Environment variables for backend, including . Created and maintained, but not modified in terms of values.
-   : Defines MongoDB models using Pydantic, representing the data structure for entities like users, organizations, jobs, etc. Crucial for data integrity and API response modeling. Created during initial setup.
-   : Contains utility functions for authentication, password hashing, JWT token handling, and user session management. This file was frequently edited to fix date/time comparison errors and  related issues, and for robust session/token handling.
-   : Various files defining API endpoints for specific resources (e.g., , , ). These were created to expose the backend functionalities as RESTful APIs.  was inspected for data retrieval issues.
-   : A Python script responsible for populating the MongoDB with initial data for testing, including organizations, users, roles, jobs, candidates, and applications. Created and rerun multiple times for debugging data-related issues.
-   : The entry point for the React application. Sets up the main  component. Updated during initial setup.
-   : The main React component responsible for routing and global context providers. Heavily modified to define all application routes, implement  for authenticated access, and manage role-based redirections.
-   : Configures the Axios HTTP client for making API requests to the backend. It includes an interceptor to attach authentication tokens. Inspected for URL construction and token issues.
-   : Manages the user's authentication state, including login, logout, token storage, and user role retrieval. Critical for implementing role-based access. Frequently updated to ensure token persistence and correct role loading.
-   : Numerous pages were created for different sections of the application:
    -   : User authentication interface. Modified to include quick access links for different user profiles and to handle role-based redirection.
    -   : General dashboard for Admin/Recruiter.
    -   : Lists job postings, modified to link to .
    -   : Displays job applications, likely in a Kanban view for recruiters. Modified to fix data loading issues.
    -   : Public-facing jobs portal. Updated to display available jobs, application functionality, and login/signup links.
    -   : For clients or recruiters to create new job postings. Debugged for submission errors.
    -   : For candidates to manage their profile, experiences, education, and questionnaires. Modified to include a navbar for logout.
    -   : Specific dashboard for clients to track their job postings.
    -   : Dashboard tailored for client users.
    -   : Dashboard tailored for candidate users.
-   : Project documentation. Initially created and later updated to include consolidated access flows.
-   : New documentation file detailing the complete user flows for all four personas.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement logout functionality across all user dashboards.
- Ensure  correctly redirects unauthenticated users to the  page when attempting to access protected routes (currently, users are stuck on the protected route).
- Complete the Trabalhe Conosco (Careers) page, including the full application flow (CV upload, questionnaires, application submission, status tracking for candidates).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing critical authentication and routing issues within the frontend. The primary focus was on ensuring proper role-based access control and navigation for all user types (Admin, Recruiter, Client, Candidate).

Specifically, the user reported that:
1.  The logout functionality was not working, and in some pages like , a logout button was not visible in the header. The AI had added a navbar to  to address this.
2.  Directly accessing a protected route (e.g., ) when unauthenticated was not redirecting the user to the login page (); instead, the user was stuck on the protected route. The AI identified that the  component was not correctly handling this redirection.

To fix the redirection issue, the AI modified , which is where the  component logic and main routing are defined. The goal of this edit was to ensure that if a user is not authenticated and tries to access a route protected by , they are explicitly redirected to .

The last action recorded was the AI stating, Vou reiniciar o frontend e verificar os logs para ver o que est√° acontecendo, indicating that the  change has been applied, and the AI is about to restart the frontend service to test the fix and observe the console logs for any further errors or unexpected behavior. This is the immediate context of the ongoing work.
